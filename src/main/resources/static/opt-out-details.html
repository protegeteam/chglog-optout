<h1>Publication of de-identified obfuscated WebProtégé change history logs for research purposes</h1>

<p>We, the Protégé team, are contacting you with regards to the projects that you own on WebProtégé
    (https://webprotege.stanford.edu). As part of our research mission into ontology engineering we intend to produce <strong>a
        dataset of de-identified obfuscated change history logs</strong> that we will share with the ontology engineering research
    community. As a user of WebProtégé, and the owner of one or more projects, we wanted to let you know that we want to
    de-identify and obfuscate the change history of your projects and include them in this dataset. It is important for
    you to know that it will be impossible for users of the dataset to reconstruct the actual ontologies from your
    WebProtégé projects or obtain identifying information from any of the change logs.</p>

<p>The rest of this email provides you with some details about why we want to do this and illustrates what de-identified
    obfuscated change logs look like. It also provides you with the opportunity to say that you don’t want some, or all,
    of your projects to be included in this dataset, in any form. In other words, you have the opportunity to “opt out”.
    Of course, since actual usernames, timestamps and ontology content won’t be visible or identifiable in this dataset,
    we very much hope you’ll be onboard with this and won’t opt out.</p>

<h2>What do we mean by change history log?</h2>

<p>As you may know, WebProtégé tracks the changes made to a project so that they can be reviewed and collaborators can
    see who did what and when they did it. The list of changes in a project is known as the <i>project change history log</i>.
    A portion of the change history for one of the Protégé team’s projects, Aero – ”An ontology of commercial aviation”,
    is show below. This portion included the changes for the class “L1011”.</p>

    <figcaption>An example of the change history for the Aero project as viewed in WebProtégé</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, the <i>plain</i> change history records date/time, the user name of the author and the axioms additions and
    removals. According to the WebProtégé terms and conditions, this information is stored securely on the WebProtégé
    server and <u>we would <i>never</i> release or publish plain change logs like this</u>. However, we would like to publish
    <u><i>de-identified obfuscated</i> versions of change logs</u>. How we get from a plain change log to a de-identified obfuscated
    change log is described below.</p>


<h2>How is a change history log de-identified and obfuscated?</h2>

<p>Taking the above plain change history log as an example, to de-identify and obfuscate it,</p>

<ol>
    <li>We remove the usernames of authors and replace them with alphanumeric identifiers. In this example “M Horridge”
        could be replaced with “U1”.
    </li>
    <li>We remove all date time details and replace these with offset timestamps, which can be used to calculate the
        number of milliseconds between changes, but cannot be used to identify the actual date or time that the changes
        took place. In this case, the fact the changes were made on August 28th and August 31st would not be
        recoverable.
    </li>
    <li>We replace all entity names with gibberish/meaningless names, so for example, “L1011” could be replaced with
        “pirad-mudag” and “skos:altLabel” with “luguv-lajuv”. Note that these gibberish names are unique to a particular
        change log. Thus “skos:altLabel” in one project history change log might be obfuscated as “pirad-mudag”, but in
        another project history it could be obfuscated as something like “falab-taduk”.
    </li>
    <li>We replace all strings, numbers and other scalar value occurrences with strong irreversible salted hashes of the
        values. In this case “Whisper Liner” would be replaced with something like
        2f904bf863792898c7297a0272e9d0407ba678d699c24eea75669f2c3d4b7e7f. Note that, this hash cannot be decoded to
        reveal the original string, “Whisper Liner”. Furthermore, if the string “Whisper Liner” occurred in multiple
        project change history logs it would have a different hashed representation in each de-identified obfuscated
        log.
    </li>
    <li>We replace all language tags with alphanumeric identifiers so that the language tag “@en” would become “@L0”.
        This removes any concrete details of the languages used by a project.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the de-identified and obfuscated change history log:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Does not contain project identifiers</li>
    <li>Does not contain real usernames</li>
    <li>Does not contain real dates or times</li>
    <li>Does not contain real or meaningful class, property, individual or datatype names</li>
    <li>Does not contain real or meaningful labels and other annotation values</li>
    <li>Does not contain real or meaningful language tags</li>
    <li>Does not contain any real or meaningful data that could be used to identify the domain modelled by the project
    </li>
    <li>Only preserves the sequence, logical and structural aspects of the change history, including the high level
        generic change types e.g. “AddedParent” and the generic OWL axioms types, e.g. “AnnotationAssertion” or
        “SubClassOf”.
    </li>
    <li>What does a de-identified obfuscated change log look like?</li>
    <li>The de-identified obfuscated change logs will be stored in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and will look
        similar to the formatted JSON below. Note that the formatted JSON below corresponds to the entries for the
        changes in the Aero log above. Notice that only the sequence, logical and structural aspect of the changes is
        preserved. There is no way to identify that the domain is commercial aviation and no way to identify usernames,
        or absolute dates and times of the original changes.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why do we want to do this?</h2>
<p>While there are many ontologies that are published online, the change histories for ontology projects are not usually
    available. This hampers researchers that are interested in ontology engineering research areas such as ontology
    evolution, ontology versioning, incremental reasoner development and optimisation, and query engine optimisation.
    Many of these research areas do not require actual identifying domain details that are pertinent to an ontology
    project, they only require logical and structural changes. Thus, having de-identified obfuscated change logs may be
    of great benefit to the field of ontology engineering research. Even though the logs that we will publish are
    generated by and specific to WebProtégé, we believe that general enough conclusions could be drawn from research
    into these logs so that it will be possible to make novel tool workflow and performance improvements.</p>

<h2>Where will the dataset of de-identified obfuscated change logs be published?</h2>
<p>We will publish the dataset online. It is likely to be published so that it is available from a sub-domain of
    https://protege.stanford.edu. This means that <u>anyone</u> will be able to access the dataset.</p>

<h2>How many de-identified obfuscated change logs will be contained in this dataset?</h2>
<p>We cannot say for definite because this depends on the number of people who opt out. However, if nobody were to opt
    out we would expect the dataset to contain around 30,000 de-identified obfuscated change logs.</p>

<h2>Who will have access to the de-identified obfuscated change logs in the dataset?</h2>
<p>Since the dataset will be published online it will be available to anyone. However, we would expect that this dataset
    is only of interest to researchers who want to use the data for studying the structural aspects of ontology
    changes.</p>

<h2>What do I do next?</h2>
<p> If you are happy for de-identified obfuscated versions of your project history to appear in this dataset then you do
    not need to do anything. If you would like to opt out please use our <a href="https://webprotege.stanford.edu/studies/chglog/opt-out">opt-out form at https://webprotege.stanford.edu/studies/chglog/opt-out</a> and follow the instructions.</p>
